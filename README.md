# Carbonic
Simple PHP framework

Use it to your likings, I found other frameworks to be usually blown way out of proportions or have extremely complicated OOP 'implementations'.

Structure?
root
|-app
|--controller
|--model
|--view
|-cache
|-css
|-carbonic (link my awesome github repo or don't... if you don't thrust my coding skills)
|-js

Requirements? A recent version of PHP (5.3+), the model uses PDO and MySQL. Maybe I'll add other DB engines as a possibility later.

Make sure the defaultController in carbonic/Config.php exists. I do not provide a controller with this package, simply because I want to be able to link this repo and all app-specific code should be outside the carbonic-folder.

I'll try to create a sample app with carbonic as its core. If I haven't done so by January 2016, don't expect it to come.
